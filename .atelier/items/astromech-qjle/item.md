## Goal

Measure astromech by Agent Factory's `procedures/garden.md`, fix the upkeep and signs it may fix, and bring Sumeet one page with at most three proposals. This is astromech's first run, so the window starts at the first line `atelier log` prints, 2026-11-11T15:20:14Z.

## Done when

- [ ] The numbers follow garden.md's steps, and `artifacts/numbers.md` holds the log lines behind them.
- [ ] At most three proposals, each one cause with its evidence counted; one that adds a rule or check names one considered for removal.
- [ ] Every change on the branch is upkeep or a sign: none adds or removes a rule, check, gate, interface or default.
- [ ] Each finding `atelier list --deferred` showed is settled.
- [ ] The page follows garden.md's template in at most 60 lines, with Session empty.

## Scope

In: garden.md steps 1 to 7 up to the approval, for astromech only.

Out: the session and what it settles, the run's merge, any new or removed rule, check, merge check or hook, a change to what the product does, astromech-6ec9 and its branch, and other items' branches.
